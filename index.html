        believe it or not (i dont) not so long ago i hardly knew you. But i first started to know you on community day is P007 
        when i spoke to you with kenzo and andre in the corner of the class where you now sit in computing. I was already in the crumbles of a relationship 
        that just wasnt right and it is safe to say you caught my eye. I first noticed your skin, it stands out thats just a known fact and we spoke about the 
        questions we were given by jane and i found out you surfed (fromt the moment I found that out it was basically confirmed that at some point i was gonna 
        go to surf with you and even now im gonna keep working toward that). you were in your classic outfit; black top, dog tags and the navy blue cargos with the 
        2 D rings on each pocket with the cloth running through it. and then we were told to move and i didnt even move away from you because i didnt know anyone 
        nd you made me feel comfortable i guess from there i gave kenzo my number and he gave it to you and i got ur snap from there.
        we texted a little bit but not much and i was still awkward af because of not knowing you well and being unsure of what i wanted reigate to be like for me but
        so far you have helped make it something special and from community day forward i looked forward to 
      </p>

      <p>
        after not too long we started to get to know eachother a bit better and i stared texting you more and 
        more, as time went by i eventually  took this picture as were walking after computing and i remeber  
        feeling mad abt it cos i didnt take a good picture and i did wanna weird u out and ask for a better one. 
        (RIP the headphones). you were always a bit mysterious to me and it was clear that you were holding back
         alot of yourself which i guess makes sense as i was still sorta new to you. I still remeber playing
         apex with you and being nervous af because im shit at apex and i was excited to speak to you. the<br>
        kenzo joined aswell which was just eh but stil worth is as it was talking to you which meant i was able to 
        work on my awkwardness (i am sorry i was so bad)
        I hope you are able to find some joy this birthday and i hope i can be involved because seeing you happy
        keeps me sane. im not ashamed to admit that you alnone have got me through majority of the shit i have
        been through at reigate without even knowing. there have been times when i have just felt shit and i 
        managed to deal with that by seeing your notification come up on my phone. so thankyou and just know
        your effrots havent gone unnoticed and it means alot to me seeing you trying.

    <p style="font-size: 35px; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"> hey, this girl isnt so bad:</p>

      <p>
        after not too long i started to know you better an soon enough you were one of the highest on my bestfriends 
        list and one of the persons i wanted to know most about you were still a mystery but it was starting to unravel bit by bit and that idea of meeting we had over 
        christmas holidays didnt seem so bad. soon enough (not soon enough for me) you came to caterham. i didnt have much of a plan but i 
        remember being nervous and wanting to ask about what we are and if it was a date. i remeber asking you outside the church when we stopped for a second.
        i asked would you consider this a date and you said idk just call it what you want which didnt fill me with confidence. I did consider asking if you wanted to 
        come to my house but i didnt want to seem to forward or make you too uncomfortable. I remember buying you that soft toy after we just stayed in the works for ages 
        and i wanted it to be smth special you could have to remember the day by because from the first hour of that day i knw i wanted it way more. I wanted to kiss you so badly when we were looking at the view in the graveyard and feeling 
        like an excieted child when i picked you up and i still feel like that every time xx. having you wrapped around me and holding on and breathing in my ear is one of the gratest things in existence and im still holing on for the day that you run and jump at me and wrap around me when you first see me. i remember taking the picture of you with that photoboard thing and i just loved the picture because you were smiling and
        it was one of the first pics i had taken of you. ill put it bellow this box cos it a cool pic (shout out that giant panda bear thing)
        <br>
        form became something to look forward to for me even if it was a pointless half an hour when we just sat their i liked being able to see you and talk to you 
        (it was worth sitting next to kenzo for that time to be able to see you) i still remeber the day that you swapped seats with him and i was gassed because 
        i could be closer to you, that sounds weird af but like yk what i mean. and i felt bad for kenzo but all i cared abt was the chance to spend more time with you.

    <p style="font-size: 35px; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">finally my girl xx:</p>

      <p>
        finally after saying we would wait for exams i asked you to be my girlfrind on the 25th of april 2023 after the computing exam 
        sat on the bench at priory park. i cant lie i was nervous af even tho you had basically aleady said you wanted to date me. 
        but sure enough you said yes and since then life has been going well for me. without you i would be lonely. i think about that
        alot because you are the person i spend most time with and yet even tho we already spend alot of time together i still want to
        be able to see you more because of how much better i often feel when you are around. we might not have had the healthiest of
        starts but even in the rough times i have felt better in your company than without it. the fact you are there and a text away
        from me always keeps me calm and i dont think i would be able to do alot of what i do if i didnt have that security i feel from 
        you. you always can make me smile when you want to whether that is being crazy with a toy making funky faces.<br>
        i am so attracted to you that it confuses me. you could be doing the most random stuff and my mind willjust be stuck 
        on the though of how good you look i hope some time i can help you to realise that. I like how cared you can make me feel i cant
        find peace when you are happy with me or telling me nice things and i thank you for everything you do for me xx
        so happy birthday. i love you loads. thankyou for the journey you have given me so far and i hope this next year and the many more to come can be spent with me.
        <br>Happy birthdayyy!!! and enjoy the pictures x
